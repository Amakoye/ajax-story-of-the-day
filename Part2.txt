Just before reaching town, Jack ran into a strange old man who told Jack that he had a small
sack of beans that he would like to trade for the cow. Jack refused the trade but then the
mysterious old man told Jack that the beans were magic and would yield a crop overnight
that would feed his family for the rest of the season.
